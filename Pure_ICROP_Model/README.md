**ICROP Model**
This repository contains code for the ICROP Model, which automates the extraction of key data fields from patient registration forms by detecting and cropping specific sections, such as patient name, age, and address. The model utilises OpenCV for image processing and customised algorithms to ensure accuracy in data extraction.
